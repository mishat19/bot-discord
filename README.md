----------------------WELCOME TO MY FIRST BOT DISCORD PROJECT----------------------
                                      
I wanted to familiarize myself with web frameworks for developing web applications. So I decided to **learn NodeJs** through a fun project: a Discord bot.

It's a **dating bot** whose main goal is to introduce people to each other by helping them make the first move, ultimately helping them form a potential friendship.
So I created a Match system that simply involves asking a person if they'd like to get to know the person who matches them — in which case, the bot will create a chat
room specifically for their match — and then each person can show their interest in the other through an interest points system (**stored in a Database with Sequelize/Sqlite3**).

The bot is **hosted on a 24/7 server on KataBump**. If you'd like to test the available **slash commands** and follow me in my future project, you can join my Discord server:
